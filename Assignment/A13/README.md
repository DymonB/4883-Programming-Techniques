# Mice and Maze UVa 1112

# Description 

A set of laboratory mice is being trained to escape a maze. The maze is made up of cells, and each cell
is connected to some other cells. However, there are obstacles in the passage between cells and therefore
there is a time penalty to overcome the passage Also, some passages allow mice to go one-way, but not
the other way round.
Suppose that all mice are now trained and, when placed in an arbitrary cell in the maze, take a
path that leads them to the exit cell in minimum time.
We are going to conduct the following experiment: a mouse is placed in each cell of the maze and
a count-down timer is started. When the timer stops we count the number of mice out of the maze.
Write a program that, given a description of the maze and the time limit, predicts the number of
mice that will exit the maze. Assume that there are no bottlenecks is the maze, i.e. that all cells have
room for an arbitrary number of mice

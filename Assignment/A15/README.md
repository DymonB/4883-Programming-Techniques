# Santa's House UVa 291
In your childhood you most likely had to solve the riddle of the house of Santa
Claus. Do you remember that the importance was on drawing the house in a
stretch without lifting the pencil and not drawing a line twice? 

Well, a couple of years later, like now, you have to “draw” the house
again but on the computer. As one possibility is not enough, we require all
the possibilities when starting in the lower left corner. Follow the example in
Figure 2 while defining your stretch.
All the possibilities have to be listed in the outputfile by increasing order,
meaning that 1234... is listed before 1235..
